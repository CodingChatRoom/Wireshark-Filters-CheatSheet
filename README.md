## 🔎 TCP Analysis  

| 🔍 **Filter** | 📌 **Use Case** |
|--------------|----------------|
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1` | Show **SYN** packets (handshake start 🤝) |
| `tcp.flags.fin == 1` | Show **FIN** packets (connection close 🔚) |
| `tcp.analysis.retransmission` | Detect **network issues** (retransmits) |
